# Income-Inequality-in-the-United-States

Income inequality is defined as the extent to which income is distributed unevenly in a group of people. 
In mostly every culture, most peopleâ€™s economic positions are also related to other characteristics, such 
as whether or not they have a disability, their ethnic background, or whether they are a man or a 
woman. Of course, if we are referring to income as monetary aspect, we can clearly say that income is 
not just the money received through pay, but all the money received from employment, investments, 
such as interest on savings accounts and dividends from shares of stock, savings, state benefits, 
pensions, and rent. Ethnically speaking, Blacks and Hispanics have faced economic inequality for 
generations, and the recent wave of Black Lives Matter protests has renewed discussions on these 
disparities. Compared to White families, other races have lower levels of income and net worth. They 
are also less likely to hold assets of any type. In fact, 19% of Black families have zero or negative net 
worth, while only 9% of White households have no wealth.
